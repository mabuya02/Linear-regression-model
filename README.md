# Linear Regression Model for Stock Price Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to build a linear regression model for predicting stock prices using historical stock data. The code uses various Python libraries for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Overview

This notebook uses the TensorFlow library to create a linear regression model. The dataset used in this example is a historical stock data file from the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The following steps are covered in the notebook:

1. Importing Libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, yfinance, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn are imported for data processing and model creation.

2. Data Loading: The historical stock data file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and missing values are handled. Outliers are detected and handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Numerical features are scaled and normalized.

4. Feature Selection: The relevant features for the model are selected, and the target variable is defined.

5. Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

6. Polynomial Transformation: Polynomial features are generated to allow for nonlinear relationships in the model.

7. Model Training: A linear regression model is created using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.

8. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2).

9. Visualization: A scatter plot with a regression line is generated to visualize the actual vs. predicted values.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
